            This was my science fair project for 2020. It was a simple app
            designed to help event/club organizers, or anyone who may need to,
            send out a text message to a large number of people.

            A small snake game that I made because I was board. It uses rust and
            web assembly for some parts because I was getting fed up with
            writing the code in JS.

            This a collaboration project between myself and Jasper Miller-Waugh,
            and will be our entry for the 2021 Science Fair. It focuses on using
            an oscilloscope as a EEG device, allowing us to multiplex channels
            together, making large channel EEG cheeper.
