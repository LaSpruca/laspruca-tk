                I am a Year 11 student at Whangarie Boys' High School, a
                swimming coach for Kamo Amateur Swimming Club, a member of
                Questionable Research Labs, and a developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                At School, I take Electronics, Digital Technology, Maths,
                Science, Economics, and English. I have competed in Science
                Fair, and have managed to win awards at the regional competition
                twice now. At Questionable, I help many of the younger attendees
                with their projects as best I can. As a developer, I mostly use
                programming languages such as Rust, which is my favorites at the
                moment, TypeScript, Java, C++. I am not a fan of JavaScript,
                Python, call me crazy, and other languages like that.

            This was my science fair project for 2020. It was a simple app
            designed to help event/club organisers, or anyone who may need to,
            send out a text message to a large number of people.
