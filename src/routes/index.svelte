                    A small snake game that I made because I was board. It uses rust
                    and web assembly for some parts because I was getting fed up with
                    writing the code in JS.

                    This a collaboration project between myself and Jasper
                    Miller-Waugh, and will be our entry for the 2021 Science Fair. It
                    focuses on using an oscilloscope as a EEG device, allowing us to
                    multiplex channels together, making large channel EEG cheeper.
